Hello! My name is Nick Gorichs. I received my BS in Engineering Physics from the University of Wisconsin - Platteville, but in my last couple semesters I took up a machine learning Research Assistant role with Dr. Hynek Boril. Since then, I have been learning all that I can about machine learning so that I can pursue it full time.
